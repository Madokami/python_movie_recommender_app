Use the following link to access the web app in a browser:
http://movie-recommender-xuzhizs2.us-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/

If somehow the link is down, you could still manually run the app on local host using the following steps:
- install dependencies (flask, numpy, and pandas)
- python application.py
- terminal will show the url to access the web app in the browser (something like http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
